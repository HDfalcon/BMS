Using BQ76952 BMS IC for a 12S BMS card.
SPI connection is setted up to code BQ76952 from STM32.
The project was put on hold before I added the bootloader, actually I was imagining a BMS which can be codded via USB connection like a development board.
I put 2 GPIO input and 2 analog input pin on board for future usages.
This was my first attempt to develop BMS, so I'm open to your advices, comments.
