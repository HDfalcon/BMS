Using BQ76952 BMS IC for a 12S BMS card.
SPI connection is setted up to code BQ76952 from STM32.
CAN bus connection is setted up for telemetry purposes with other electrical parts of car. 
The project was put on hold before I added the bootloader, actually I was envisioning a BMS which can be codded via USB connection like a development board.
I put 2 GPIO input and 2 analog input pin on board for future usages.
This was my first attempt to develop BMS, so I'm open to your advices, comments.
